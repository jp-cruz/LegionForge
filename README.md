# LegionForge

**A local-first, security-native AI agent framework built on LangGraph.**

> Security is enforced in the execution path — not layered on afterward.

---

## What Is This?

LegionForge is an open-source framework for building hardened AI agent systems on local hardware. It runs local LLMs (via Ollama) or cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), with a full security stack baked into every layer of the execution pipeline.

**The one-line pitch:** The hardened, self-hosted alternative to cloud agent platforms — and a security layer that other agent frameworks can plug into.

---

## Core Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Fail-safe tiering** | `halt → sandbox/retry → degrade` — never silent failure |
| **Human gates on all mutations** | No component autonomously changes security rules, promotes tools, or escalates privileges |
| **Replace AI with determinism** | Repeated deterministic tasks are crystallized into signed, containerized tools with zero LLM overhead |
| **Validate at trust boundaries** | Guardian enforces checks at every inbound/outbound boundary — agents are processing nodes, not trust boundaries |
| **Privilege tied to tasks** | Short-lived task tokens scoped to exactly what the current task requires |

---

## Security Architecture

### Guardian Sidecar
A standalone FastAPI process (`:9766`) that runs a **deterministic-only** 7-check pipeline — no LLM calls in the hot path. Fast, auditable, unpoisonable.

```
Check 0: Tool revocation  (REVOKED status — immediate halt)
Check 1: Tool registry + SHA-256 hash validation
Check 2: Capability boundary enforcement (negative capability list)
Check 3: Destructive pattern detection in tool args
Check 4: Agent sequence contract validation
Check 5: Ed25519 signature verification
Check 6: Adaptive threat rules (hot-reloaded every 10s — no restart needed)
```

### Crystallization Pipeline
When agents solve the same deterministic problem repeatedly, the Observer nominates it for crystallization. The Crystallizer generates a deterministic function + test suite. A Pre-HITL Analyzer (AST guards + behavioral diff) runs before human approval. Once signed, the tool has zero LLM runtime cost.

```
Observer → Crystallizer → Pre-HITL Analyzer → Human gate → Ed25519-signed tool
```

### Threat Coverage

| Threat | Defense |
|---|---|
| **Tool Poisoning** | Hash validation at registration + cryptographic signing |
| **Rug-Pull** | Hash mismatch detection + signed tool versions |
| **Prompt Injection** (direct + indirect) | Input/output sanitizer + RAG provenance scoring |
| **Capability Amplification** | Negative capability list enforced by Guardian |
| **Resource Bomb / Economic DOS** | Pre-execution token cost estimator + rate limiter |
| **Credential Theft** | Keychain storage + PII redaction from all outbound calls |
| **RAG / Memory Poisoning** | Document provenance + embedding trust scoring |
| **Multi-Agent Cascade** | Orchestrator-only routing + signed inter-agent messages |
| **Supply Chain** | AI-BOM + signed tool library |
| **TOCTOU** | `approved_snapshot` verified post-execution in `SecureToolNode` |

cd LegionForge
python -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Set your hardware profile
export AGENT_HARDWARE_PROFILE=mac_m4_mini_16gb

# 3. Store your PostgreSQL admin password
echo "localhost:5432:*:$(whoami):yourpassword" >> ~/.pgpass && chmod 0600 ~/.pgpass
# New install with default Homebrew trust auth? Use:
# export POSTGRES_TRUST_AUTH=true

# 4. Initialize the database and generate security secrets
make db-init
make setup-task-token-secret
make setup-signing-key

make guardian-start  # Security sidecar :9766 (requires Docker)

# 7. Create a user and open the web UI

## Known Gaps (Accepted Residual Risk)

- **Embedding-level anomaly detection** — RAG poisoning at the semantic vector level is an open research problem. Provenance scoring and trust flagging exist; embedding-level detection is deferred.
- **Transitive dependency hash pinning** — `requirements.lock` pins direct and transitive deps; CVE scanning via `make dep-audit` (pip-audit) runs in CI. Deep transitive hash attestation is accepted residual risk.
