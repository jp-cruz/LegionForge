## What Is LegionForge?

LegionForge is an open-source framework for running hardened AI agent systems on your own hardware. It runs local LLMs via [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or cloud APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic), with a full security stack baked into every layer of the execution pipeline — not bolted on afterward.

**The one-line pitch:** The hardened, self-hosted alternative to cloud agent platforms — and a security layer that other agent frameworks can plug into.

**Why it exists:** In January 2026, OpenClaw hit 60,000 GitHub stars in 72 hours and 300,000+ users in weeks. Kaspersky found 512 vulnerabilities (8 critical). Cisco found active data exfiltration in third-party skills. LegionForge is built in the opposite order: security first, product on top.

## Key Numbers

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Smoke tests (no services required) | **2247 / 2247 passing** (~21s) |
| Integration tests (PostgreSQL) | **41 / 41 passing** |
| Kerberos live-KDC tests | **5 / 5 passing** |
| UI tests (Playwright) | **40 / 40 passing** |
| Tool accuracy tests | **79 / 79 passing** |
| Guardian security checks per tool call | **7** (deterministic, 0 LLM calls) |
| Threat classes covered | **11** |
| Prompt injection detection patterns | **29** (2-tier: halt + log) |
| Auth backends | **5** (API key, OIDC, GitHub, LDAP, Kerberos) |
| Channel connectors | **4** (Discord, Telegram, Slack, Webhook) |

---

## Core Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|---|---|
| **Fail-safe tiering** | `halt → sandbox/retry → degrade` — never silent failure |
| **Human gates on all mutations** | No component autonomously changes security rules, promotes tools, or escalates privileges |
| **Replace AI with determinism** | Repeated deterministic tasks crystallize into signed, containerized tools with zero LLM overhead |
| **Validate at trust boundaries** | Guardian enforces checks at every inbound/outbound boundary — agents are processing nodes, not trust boundaries |
| **Privilege tied to tasks** | Short-lived JWT task tokens scoped to exactly what the current task requires |

---

## User Interfaces

Submit tasks from wherever you already are:

| Interface | How |
|---|---|
| **Web UI** | `http://localhost:8080/ui` — live SSE streaming, tool call blocks, session history |
| **Discord** | `!<task>` in any channel the bot can see |
| **Telegram** | `/<task>` to your bot |
| **Slack** | `!<task>` via Socket Mode (no public URL needed) |
| **Webhook** | `POST :8081/inbound` — HMAC-SHA256 verified, works with n8n / Zapier / any HTTP client |
| **REST API** | `POST /tasks` + `GET /tasks/{id}/stream` — full SSE streaming |

---

## Security Architecture

### Guardian Sidecar

A standalone FastAPI process (`:9766`) running a **deterministic-only** 7-check pipeline on every tool call. No LLM calls in the hot path. Unpoisonable. Fails safe to `halt` on any error.

```
Check 0  Tool revocation      — REVOKED tools blocked before any other check (cache TTL: 10s)
Check 1  Registry + Hash      — tool must be APPROVED; SHA-256 hash must match registration
Check 2  Capability boundary  — negative capability list enforced per agent profile
Check 3  Destructive patterns — regex detection of destructive command patterns in tool args
Check 4  Sequence contract    — agent tool sequences validated; deviations → sandbox retry
Check 5  Ed25519 signature    — crystallized tools must carry a valid signing-keypair signature
Check 6  Adaptive rules       — human-approved threat rules hot-reload every 10s; no restart
```

### Crystallization Pipeline

When agents solve the same deterministic problem repeatedly, LegionForge crystallizes the solution into a signed, containerized tool — zero LLM inference cost for routine work.

```
Observer ──▶ Crystallizer ──▶ Pre-HITL Analyzer ──▶ Human Gate ──▶ Ed25519-Signed Tool
```

The Pre-HITL Analyzer runs AST guards (subscript bypass, MRO traversal, `globals()`/`locals()` hijack) and behavioral diffs before any human reviews a proposal.

### Multi-Provider Authentication

The gateway supports five auth backends — swap without touching agent code:

| Backend | Scheme | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| `ApiKeyBackend` | Bearer | Default — bcrypt API keys in PostgreSQL |
| `OIDCBackend` | Bearer | Google, Okta, Auth0, Azure AD, Keycloak, Cognito |
| `GitHubOAuthBackend` | Bearer | GitHub OAuth app tokens |
| `LDAPBackend` | Basic | OpenLDAP, Active Directory |
| `KerberosBackend` | Negotiate | Kerberos/GSSAPI (requires KDC + keytab) |

Set `gateway.auth_provider` in your hardware profile YAML.

### Threat Coverage

| Threat | Defense |
|---|---|
| **Tool Poisoning** | SHA-256 hash validation at registration + Ed25519 cryptographic signing |
| **Rug-Pull** | Hash mismatch detection + signed tool versioning |
| **Prompt Injection** (direct + indirect) | 29-pattern sanitizer (Tier 1 halt / Tier 2 log) + NFKC normalization + zero-width char stripping + RAG provenance scoring |
| **Capability Amplification** | Negative capability list enforced by Guardian Check 2 |
| **Resource Bomb / Economic DOS** | Pre-execution token cost estimator + per-user daily budgets + per-provider rate limits |
| **Credential Theft** | macOS Keychain / `~/.pgpass` storage + PII redaction from all outbound API calls |
| **RAG / Memory Poisoning** | Document provenance scoring + embedding trust threshold flagging |
| **Multi-Agent Cascade** | Orchestrator-only routing + signed inter-agent messages |
| **Supply Chain** | AI-BOM + signed tool library + SHA-256 GGUF model integrity verification |
| **TOCTOU** | `approved_snapshot` stored pre-execution; post-execution result verified against snapshot |
| **AST Bypass** | Subscript, MRO traversal, `globals()`/`locals()` hijack detection in crystallization analyzer |

## Known Gaps (Accepted Residual Risk)

- **Embedding-level anomaly detection** — RAG poisoning at the semantic vector level is an open research problem. Provenance scoring and trust flagging exist; embedding-level detection is deferred.
- **pip-audit / dependency hash pinning** — Managed via Dependabot. `pip-audit` reports no known CVEs; transitive hash pinning is accepted residual risk.
- **langchain 1.x migration** — Planned for a future phase; current stack runs langchain 0.3.x. A LOW-severity SSRF CVE in `langchain-core` is accepted risk (LegionForge never calls the affected method with image content).

## Acknowledgements

LegionForge exists in a space shaped by several projects and thinkers worth calling out directly.

**[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw)** (Peter Steinberger — née Clawd → Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw) — the primary inspiration for LegionForge. Proved the demand (60,000 GitHub stars in 72 hours), proved the architecture (six-component structure, workspace-as-files memory), and proved what happens when security is an afterthought (512 vulnerabilities, active data exfiltration in third-party skills). LegionForge is building in the opposite order: security first, product on top.

**[LangGraph](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph)** — the graph execution engine underneath everything. Checkpoint-based state persistence, loop protection, and graph resumption are LangGraph primitives that LegionForge builds on heavily.

**[LATM — Learning to Use Tools by Making Them](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17126)** (Cai et al., ICLR 2024) and **[Voyager](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16291)** (Wang et al., NVIDIA 2023) — the foundational academic work closest to LegionForge-Anneal's tool crystallization pipeline.

**[Anchor Engine](https://github.com/RSBalchII/anchor-engine-node)** by Robert S. Balch II — deterministic semantic memory using graph traversal (the STAR algorithm). Anchor's insight that agent memory should be *explainable and deterministic* directly informed LegionForge's temporal decay memory recall. The STAR gravity formula is adapted from Anchor's published whitepaper.

**[The AI-Human Engineering Stack](https://github.com/hjasanchez/agentic-engineering)** by Hayen Mill and Henrique Jr. Sanchez (March 2026) — a five-layer framework for AI engineering (Prompt, Context, Intent, Judgment, Coherence). The KV-cache stability insight from this paper directly motivated the context ordering in LegionForge's agent message assembly.

The security-first design here is a direct response to watching these ecosystems grow fast and ship security as an afterthought. That's not a criticism — it's the reality of how open-source moves. This project is an attempt to show what the stack looks like when security is the first constraint, not the last.
